// i have this about page, there are 2 parts, left parts (text) and right part (image), i set the default as flex-col, and when in medium it will be flex-row, so the text and the image will be side to side, but on the breakpoint md the text and the image are not equal, the image is shown little, but when i stretch it to more big (lg, xl), the size is equal
